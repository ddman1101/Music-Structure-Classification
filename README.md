# CRNN-use-in-salami-dataset-structure-classification(Still in the progress)

This task is about music structure classification. And we establish the CRNN to classify the music structure. We use Salami-dataset to be the training data, testing data and validation data. After we trained it 1000 Epochs, we get the 0.87 accuracy in this task for testing. Then we also use the trained model testing in EDM dataset. We got 0.94 accuracy in EDM dataset.

* Data-preprocessing-1 : Containing the data preprocessing part and model part.
* Test-EDM-dataset : Also contain the data preprocessing part and the model part.

## Requirements
* python 3.8
* tensorflow 2.x.x
